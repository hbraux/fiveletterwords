# fiveletterwords

Some implementations of the  ***five five-letter words with twenty-five unique letters?*** problem described in this 
video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w and for which one solution is "jumpy, chivw, grosz, fldxt, baken"

The objective is to compare how different programming languages implement the same algorithm, especially
regarding code readability, conciseness and performances.

### Algorithm

First of all the dictionary of 5 letter English words is lower-cased and filtered to keep only the words having
non-unique letters. This step is excluded from the benchmark.

Then the algorithm is using the *divide and conquer* principle to find the solution in a minimum of time: the words set is
split into 2 parts: a set containing a given letter (example "e") and a set not containing this letter.

The letter is not chosen randomly or alphabetically, but is the most frequent english letter that is not yet part of the 
partial solution (set of word satisfying the condition). This allows a better distribution between the sets 

Then for each word in the first set, we concatenate the word with the partial solution, filter out all the words from the 
second set that has a duplicate letter with this concatenation, and for the other ones call the same function recursively.

The algorithm stops whenever a partial solution has 25 letters. A solution is found in just a few seconds (the run time 
are given below).

Another possible optimisation would to refactor the function that checks if a string contains a letter, since it called
more than 300 million times! Since each word has unique letters, a word could be mapped to a Long value where each bit
represents a letter, and a simple AND would detect duplicate letters.

### Kotlin

* The code is small, short and easy to understand. The performances are quite good (~1500ms)

### Rust
